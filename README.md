* FAIR data: probably some deliverables from FAIRsFAIR and a lot of blah blah from many, but basically whatever can be found in F-UJI (see below).
* FAIR Software: https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis/, https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef/
* Research Objects: https://www.researchobject.org/ and the most up-to-date implementation at https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/, which will be the one that we will assess for FAIRness.
